This file holds all the different MSI Extensions. 

-> Copy the .sex file to Simba/Extensions

-> Restart Simba
   -> Go to View > Extensions
   -> Check off the extension you just copied
   -> Restart Simba

-> To use the msi_player_remote extension:
   -> Run an MSI script
   -> Go to MSI > Player Remote in the Simba menu bar
   -> Set whichever player's information you want
   -> Hit the Save button

Simple as that! :)

If an extension is updated, you have to replace your
current file with the updated one.

Enjoy,
The MSI Team
